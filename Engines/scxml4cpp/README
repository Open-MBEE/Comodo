DESCRIPTION
scxml4cpp is a C++ library to interpret SCXML models. 
Only a subset of the standard SCXML features are implemented.

scxml4cpp is composed of 2 libraries:
- scxml4cpp/engine which is the SCXML interpreter 
- scxml4cpp/parser which is the SCXML parser
There is also a test application scxml4cpp/exec.

DEPENDENCIES
The scxml4cpp/parser requires scxml4cpp/engine and xerces-c 
ver. 3.1.1.
The test application scxml4cpp/exec requires the engine and 
the parser.

INSTALLATION
In order compile scxml4cpp you need to have first installed 
xerces-c ver. 3.1.1 libraries. 

You can specify in which directory to install the headers, 
libraries, and binaries by defining:
INSTALL_INC (default is /usr/local/include)
INSTALL_LIB (default is /usr/local/lib)
INSTALL_BIN (default is /usr/local/bin)

For example to compile the scxml4cpp/engine:
cd scxml4cpp/engine/src
make INSTALL_INC=myInstallPathForHeaders/include \
     INSTALL_LIB=myInstallPathForLibraries/lib \
     INSTALL_BIN=myInstallPathForBinaries/bin \ 
     clean all install
